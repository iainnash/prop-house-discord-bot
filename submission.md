tl,dr;

a twitter + discord bot for users to stay up to date with all prop house updates

https://twitter.com/prophouse_bot and https://github.com/iainnash/prop-house-discord-bot

### why?

this allows users to keep up with their favorite prop houses and to surface new prop house auctions to users that may be unfamiliar with other communities

i've also open-sourced the code for people to update and make their own bots. the code is written in typescript and is lightweight as possible. a really typescript SDK interface allowing anyone to interact with the prop house as easy as one line of JS is also included.

### who?

i'm a protocol / backend engineer trying to better understand who nouns community interacts and build tools / memes on top of the infastructure built out by the nouns community.

### what will funding bring?

funding will help keep the api running on paid cloud servers and allow for time to review PRs / maintain and update the bot in the medium term.
