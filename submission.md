Bot preview: https://twitter.com/prophouse_bot

Working source code: https://github.com/iainnash/prop-house-discord-bot

### why?

this allows users to keep up with their favorite prop houses and to surface new prop house auctions to users that may be unfamiliar with other communities

the channels that currently are supported are rich discord channels (buttons and message that update based on subscription status) and a public twitter feed for all prop houses that can be re-tweeted by community or split into different twitter accounts as time goes on.

i've also open-sourced the code for people to update and make their own bots. the code is written in typescript and is lightweight as possible. a really typescript SDK interface allowing anyone to interact with the prop house as easy as one line of JS is also included.

### roadmap:

1. run the bot with production servers (within 2 weeks of funding)
2. install on prop house discord with approval
3. include feature to watch for proposal server changes automatically (~ 1 month)
4. respond to user feedback and improvements /   review PRs (~ 2 months)
